**Figure.** Electric field in Mn<sub>12</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>F crystal. Upper part of the figure shows scheme of the crystal with blue dots as [Mn<sub>12</sub>]<sup>-</sup>, and red dots as positively charged counterions. Mn atoms are purple balls. Oxygen and carbon atoms are at vertices of red and grey bars, correspondingly. Hydrogen and fluorine atoms are at the open ends of white and green bars, correspondingly. Four water molecules are shown as blue-white sticks. Four carboxylate groups O<sub>2</sub>C-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>F in front and four at back of the molecule are removed for clarity.
